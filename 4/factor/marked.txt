Trying to build factor: 
gcc -Wall factor.c my_math.c
factor.c:2:9: fatal error: conio.h: No such file or directory
 #include<conio.h>
         ^~~~~~~~~
compilation terminated.
my_math.c:1:10: fatal error: my_math.h: No such file or directory
 #include <my_math.h>
          ^~~~~~~~~~~
compilation terminated.
Couldn't compile factor! (10 marks!) Make sure your program compiles.
