This code takes a value of n and prints a list of the all the 'sum + i * i' (means sum add i multiplied by i) from 0 to the value of n, increasing i by 1 each iteration. Each operation in this code takes a constant time. Say if each operation takes c time. The time taken for the lines of code to executed will depend on what value of n is inputted by the user. In the worst case, the value of n is so big that the code simply does not have enough memory space to carry out this many iterations and causes the program to crash. In the best case, the value of n is close to 0 that the finished code is executed within a few nanoseconds. This means that the bigger the value of n, the longer the code will take to execute and give a result.
