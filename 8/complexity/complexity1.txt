This code takes a value of n and prints a list of the all the 'sum + i * i' (means sum add i multiplied by i) from 0 to the value of n, increasing i by 1 each iteration. Each operation in this code takes a constant time. Say if each operation takes c time. The time taken for the lines of code to executed will depend on what value of n is inputted by the user. This means that the bigger the value of n, the longer the code will take to execute and give a result.
